This is a very simple game of ping-pong.
There is two player : the racket on the left can be control  with the "z" and "s" keys, the second racket can  be control with the "p" and "m" keys.
When a player score, the ball and racket positions are reset and you need to press either z,s,p or m keys to restart the game.
